OFCOURSE VISUAL MUSIC SYLLABUS

INTRODUCTION 11:00 – 11:30

 Listen and see…
 
- What do you hear? Rhythm, Melody, Harmony, Dynamics, Timbre / Tone…
- What do you see? color, movements, shapes, patterns, narrative…
- What does computer hear? Frequency, Amplitude (Volume), Spectrum, Channels, Hrz/kHrz
- What are the connections? 
- 
- Examples: Kynd - Lilium | SjQ++ | Labuat - Paint a song | Metope - Rebird

1.SOUND PLAY 11:30 – 12: 30

- SoundPlayer
- SoundPlayerMultiple
-	SoundPlayerVideo 

2.AUDIO INPUT 1:00 – 2:00

- ofSoundStream: generate sounds, input stream 
- AudioIn(): microphone detection

3.AUDIO SPECTRUM + VISUAL PROCESSING 2:00-3:00

Using the components of Fast Fourier Transition such as bandwidth, frequency, and amplitude to create movements on graphics, images and videos. Make arbitrary choices for visualization.
- Equalizer 
- Graphics 
- Image Distortion 

4.PIXEL OPERATION (3:00-4:00)

- Image Pixilation (FFT and Volume) 
( Getting Pixels: unsigned char *data = image.getPixels() )

OF_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE:
valA = data[index];

OF_IMAGE_COLOR:
valR = data[index * 3];
valG = data[index * 3 + 1];
valB = data[index * 3 + 2];

- Pixilation with easyCam
- 
- Live Video(ofVideoGrabber)

5.GENERATIVE SOUND / MIDI (After 4:00)

- Synthesis midi/OSC/Python/addons

6.INSPIRATIONS
